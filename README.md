# FoodEaze

Can’t quite decide whether cooking or eating out sounds more appealing for the evening?? And even if that choice is simple, personal choices can make it complicated. Vegan, Nut-Free, Alcohol-Free, etc. 

FoodEaze provides the bridge for the gap of the two. Users can search for a food type or specific meal and find both highly rated recipes and restaurants, tailored to their personal preferences and choices!
